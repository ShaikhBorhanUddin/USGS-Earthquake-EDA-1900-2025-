## üåç Project Overview

This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global earthquake activity from 1900 to 2025, using data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal of this analysis is to uncover long-term seismic trends, geographical distributions, magnitude characteristics, and temporal patterns of earthquakes worldwide. Through Python-based visualization and geospatial analysis, this project aims to provide insights into the frequency, strength, and spatial behavior of earthquakes over the last 125 years, helping to better understand Earth‚Äôs seismic activity patterns. 

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset 

The project uses the [Earthquakes Around the World (1900‚Äì2025) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/earthquakes-around-the-world-from-1900-2025/data) , compiled from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) global earthquake records. It provides a comprehensive record of worldwide seismic activity spanning over 125 years, covering diverse geological regions and magnitudes. Each record represents a single earthquake event and includes essential attributes that enable both temporal and spatial analysis.
